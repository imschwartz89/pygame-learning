# Screensaver
These are scripts that behave like an old screensaver would. However, these should not be used as a screensaver.

**squares.py** - simple squares bounce around and hit non moving squares. When a moving square collides with a non moving square, the moving square changes direction and the non moving square disappears. There are never more than 10 moving squares.
<br />**FUTURE WORK squares.py:**
- [ ] add non moving squares with a key press
- [ ] add moving squares with a key press
- [ ] use the outside perimeter of the square to test for collisions instead of testing points
